#   One or two characters. First character is the command:
#     c: connect
#     u: update position
#     d: disconnect
#   Second character only applies to position and specifies direction (udlr)

#  Server->Client
#   '|' delimited pairs of positions to draw the players (there is no
#     distinction between the players - not even the client knows where its
#     player is.
